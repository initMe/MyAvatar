# **App Name**: Ethereal Echo

## Core Features:

- Avatar Generation: Allows users to upload a personal photo, which is then transformed into a stylized 2D digital avatar. The feature uses a default avatar as a placeholder, in case a user does not want to upload their image.
- Text-based Chat: A chat window, either floating or centrally located, enabling users to send and receive text messages. Implements styling inspired by cyberpunk and glassmorphism.
- Voice Interaction: Enables voice input via button activation. Uses generative AI as a tool to determine whether and when it should incorporate the context from previous turns in the conversation, thus creating continuity.
- Feature Highlights: The application must show a collection of cards. The card contents must briefly explain key aspects such as companionship, emotional support, and engaging conversation. Each card may use subtle animation or neon highlights.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Purple (#BE29EC) to evoke futuristic and vibrant feelings.
- Background color: Dark navy (#13161D) to enhance the neon effects.
- Accent color: Cyan (#29ECCE) for interactive elements, providing a sharp contrast and modern look.
- Use Orbitron for headers to convey a futuristic aesthetic, complemented by Roboto for body text to maintain readability.
- Implement a split layout with the digital avatar on the left and the chat interface on the right. Use glassmorphism effects for panels to create depth and visual interest.
- Incorporate subtle animations for the digital avatar and interactive elements to enhance the user experience. Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions and animations.
